# Minecraft-MCPI-Python-Programs
A collection of programs I made for Minecraft on Raspberry Pi
So far I have one.
Feel free to edit and use them.

Descriptions:
1. OtherBlock.py
   This program allows you to use a simple window to place down blocks that aren't able to be placed down normally
   Blocks: Primed TNT, Cobweb, Water, Lava, Active Furnace. More can easily be added.
   
2. SuperFlat.py
   Makes a world Superflat, is very slow. You COULD edit the code for a Primed TNT world, but that is not recommended.
   
Soon:
   TNT Run minigame program
