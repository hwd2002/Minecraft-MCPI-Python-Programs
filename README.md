# Minecraft-MCPI-Python-Programs
A collection of programs I made for Minecraft on Raspberry Pi
So far I have one.
Feel free to edit and use them.

Descriptions:
1. OtherBlock.py
   This program allows you to use a simple window to place down blocks that aren't able to be placed down normally
   Blocks: Primed TNT, Cobweb, Water, Lava, Active Furnace. More can easily be added.
   
2. SuperFlat.py
   Makes a world Superflat, is very slow. You COULD edit the code for a Primed TNT world, but that is not recommended.

3. TNTRun.py
   Makes a basic TNT Run Platform and removes blocks under entities. If you add mobs to the world they will be placed in the glass     room and one will be added onto the arena once per round.
   The bed is for setting your spawn in a survival hacked MCPI game.
   Remove the sandstone to disable the center raised area.
   Remove the gravel to disable gravel falling.
   Break the TNT to start game, then go to glass platform above arena to drop.
   
4. SHMUP.py
   An attemt to make a basic shooter game. Doesn't work that well yet.
